# Overview
I chose Option 2 and add a new feature to the game.

The food has three types: Orange, Red and Green.
- If the snake eats the orange food, it behaves as before: move faster and get one point.
- If the sname eats the red food, it gets faster and get two points.
- If the snake eats the green food, it get one point but doesn't move faster.

# Rubric Satisfied
- The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures
- The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques
- Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members
- Class constructors utilize member initialization lists
- The project makes use of references in function declarations
